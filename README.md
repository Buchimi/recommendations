# Recommendations
## Why this repository
Hello, My name is Michael. Nice to meet you :3.

So I'm building this mini project to play around with recommendation algorithms. Particularly Alternating least squares.
I have developed a bit of an interest in AI/ML and I wanted to see what I can do when it came to recommendations.

I don't know what I wish to do with this repository but I'll play around with it.
It may be a fun side project, where you can add the artists you like and I try to recommend what you like.
